        <h2>Cooking Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C)</li>
            <li>Cook the lasagna noodles according to package instructions until al dente, then drain and set aside.
            </li>
            <li>In a large skillet, brown the ground beef or Italian sausage over medium-high heat until no longer
                pink.
                Add the chopped onion and garlic, and cook until softened.</li>
            <li>Add the crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, basil, oregano, salt, and pepper to the skillet, and stir to
                combine. Simmer the sauce for 15-20 minutes until it thickens.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, mix together the ricotta cheese, 1 1/2 cups of the shredded mozzarella cheese,
                Parmesan cheese, and egg until well combined.</li>
            <li>To assemble the lasagna, spread a thin layer of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.
                Arrange 3 lasagna noodles on top of the sauce, followed by another layer of meat sauce, and then a
                layer
                of the cheese mixture. Repeat these layers two more times, ending with a layer of meat sauce on top.
            </li>
            <li>Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 cup of shredded mozzarella cheese over the top of the lasagna.</li>
            <li>Cover the baking dish with foil and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and
                continue baking for an additional 25-30 minutes, or until the cheese is melted and bubbly.</li>
            <li>Let the lasagna cool for 10-15 minutes before slicing and serving. Garnish with fresh parsley if
                desired.</li>
