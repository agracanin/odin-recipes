        <h2>Cooking Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti noodles and cook according to package
                instructions until al dente.</li>
            <li>While the pasta cooks, cook the bacon or pancetta in a large skillet over medium-high heat until crispy.
                Add the minced garlic to the skillet and cook for an additional minute until fragrant.</li>
            <li>In a medium bowl, whisk together the eggs, Parmesan cheese, black pepper, and a pinch of salt.</li>
            <li>When the pasta is done cooking, reserve 1 cup of the pasta cooking water, then drain the spaghetti.</li>
            <li>Add the hot spaghetti to the skillet with the bacon or pancetta and toss to combine.</li>
            <li>Remove the skillet from heat and pour the egg mixture over the spaghetti, tossing quickly to coat the
                noodles. If the pasta seems dry, add a little bit of the reserved pasta cooking water to the skillet and
                toss again.</li>
            <li>Serve the spaghetti alla Carbonara hot, topped with extra Parmesan cheese and fresh parsley if desired.
            </li>
        </ol>
    </div>
    <p>Note: Be sure to toss the pasta quickly with the egg mixture to prevent the eggs from scrambling. If you're
        concerned about the raw eggs, you can cook the egg mixture in a double boiler until thickened before adding it
        to the pasta.</p>
