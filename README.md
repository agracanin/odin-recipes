# Recipe Website Project from The Odin Project

This is a recipe website project completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. The purpose of this project was to practice and solidify my understanding of Git basics, HTML basics, and CSS basics.

## Project Description

The goal of the project was to create a recipe website that includes a homepage, multiple recipe pages and a way to navigate around the site. The recipe pages all include descriptions of the entree, ingredients required and detailed instructions.

## Skills Learned

Through this project, I was able to solidify my understanding of the following skills:

Git basics: creating and managing branches, committing changes, and pushing changes to a remote repository.
HTML basics: creating basic web pages with HTML tags, attributes, and elements.
CSS basics: styling web pages with CSS rules, properties, and values.
